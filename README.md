# Dutch_Language_Model
Here you find a Dutch Language Model trained using the Jupyter Notebooks developed by the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) team. 

More details about the model, code and ULMFiT can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146), [here](https://youtu.be/MDX_x6rKXAs) and [here](https://github.com/fastai/course-nlp/blob/master/nn-vietnamese.ipynb).

It took about 60 hours to train this model (10 epochs) on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB GPU.
